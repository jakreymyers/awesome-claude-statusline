## [Unreleased]

## [2.12.0] - 2025-10-19

### Changed
- **Sync Status Always Visible**: Git sync status indicators (‚ÜëN ‚ÜìN) now remain visible at all times, providing consistent feedback about branch sync state
  - Previously: Sync status would disappear when synced or when no upstream tracking existed
  - Now: Always displays sync indicators, dimmed for visual consistency with file change indicators
  - Improved user experience with persistent sync state visibility

### Added
- **N/A Display for No-Remote Branches**: Branches without remote tracking now display "N/A" instead of "‚Üë0 ‚Üì0"
  - Clear differentiation between "synced with remote" (‚Üë0 ‚Üì0) and "no remote tracking" (N/A)
  - Helps developers quickly identify local-only branches
  - Consistent with Git Flow workflow patterns

### Fixed
- **Sync Status Display Logic**: Resolved issue where sync status would not appear for branches with no upstream tracking
  - Fixed conditional logic to always show sync status regardless of remote state
  - Ensures sync indicators match the visual consistency of file change indicators

### Documentation
- **Updated README**: Comprehensive documentation updates for sync status behavior
  - Line 1 example updated to show always-visible dimmed sync status
  - gitflow_info component documentation clarified
  - Added explanations for N/A vs ‚Üë0 ‚Üì0 display states

## [2.11.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Git Flow Enhanced Display**: New `gitflow_info` component with comprehensive Git Flow support
  - Branch type detection with dynamic icons (üåø feature, üöÄ release, üî• hotfix, üè† main, üîÄ develop)
  - Sync status indicators (‚Üë ahead, ‚Üì behind of remote)
  - File change counts (‚óè modified, ‚úö added, ‚úñ deleted, ? untracked)
  - Merge target display (üéØ ‚Üí shows where branch will merge)
- New Git Flow helper functions in `lib/git.sh`:
  - `get_git_flow_branch_type()` - Detects branch type and returns appropriate icon
  - `get_git_flow_merge_target()` - Determines merge destination based on Git Flow conventions
  - `get_git_sync_status()` - Compact ahead/behind sync status
  - `get_git_file_changes()` - File change counts in statusline format

### Changed
- Replaced `git_branch` component with enhanced `gitflow_info` component in default layout
- All Git Flow icons are properly dimmed for visual consistency
- Branch names maintain brown color (#7F5632) for consistency
- Git Flow information properly separated with ÔΩ• delimiters
